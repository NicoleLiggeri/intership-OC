# Intership OpenCitations - Nicole Liggeri

## Day 1 (5/12/2023) - 5h
- Introductory meeting to establish the main goals of the internship.
- Completed the reading of suggested articles for a general understanding of the structure of OpenCitations.
- General overview of Scimago, ERIH-PLUS, DBLP, PubMed, DOAJ.

## Day 2 (6/12/2023) - 3h
- I have created a table to update the characteristics of various journal ranks (quality, license, list of primary classification, secondary classification, etc.).
- I started by analyzing Scimago, but then I moved on to ERIH-PLUS (excellent quality, cc by, etc.).
- ERIH-PLUS connects to a long list of other journal ranks (about fifteen - VABB-SHW, SciELO ecc.) and I have superficially checked some of them. I have added all of them to the table.

## Day 3 (18/1/2024) - 6h
- I have updated the table with information related to Scimago, ERIH-PLUS, DBLP, PubMed, DOAJ. Except for Scimago, the other lists are published under CC BY or CC0.
- I copied and saved the list of ERIH-Plus.
